I liked it very much. Then we communicated with each other and it was agreed to work on his site as a **training method**. <br />
I made some modifications to make it suitable and <br />
responsive to all different sizes of screens, <br />
and the work was completed. In no more than **15 hours**, <br />
I hope you like it
